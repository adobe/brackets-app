	<h2>Oops! I can't find the brackets index.html file</h2>
	<p>The "brackets" folder that contains the HTML/CSS/JS source code for Brackets might be missing. Here are some tips for troubleshooting:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you downloaded Brackets from GitHub, you might have clicked the "Download as ZIP" button, which doesn't work. Instead, go to https://github.com/adobe/brackets/downloads and choose the newest ZIP file link under "Download Packages".</li>
		<li>If you cloned the brackets-app repo from GitHub, make sure your submodules are updated by running <br/><code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code> inside the brackets-app folder.</li>
		<li>Don't move the Brackets.app file out of the bin/mac directory. (We'll make this a real package eventually.)</li>
		<li>If all else fails, contact us at:
			<ul>
				<li>Twitter: @brackets</li>
				<li>IRC: #brackets on freenode</li>
				<li>Developer mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/brackets-dev</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="small">Sorry about the inconvenience. We're still really early in development and haven't had time to build an installer.</p>
